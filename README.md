# Watch Something Queer
## Objective:
### Have been both a producer and consumer of queer content my whole life, I often have friends ask me for recommendations for what to watch next with the caveat that there be queer representation in it.  This sight is an easy thing to point them to.  Also, as a viewer I am always looking for something new to watch and end up just reading lists of suggestions that are all the same, so I'm also making this because I simply wish that it existed.
